Today, 50 percent of commuters take transit to downtown Minneapolis. Expanding our transit system will give this option to more people, leading to less wear-and-tear on our heavily subsidized road system, less air pollution and transportation cost savings for many families. </p>\n<p></p>\n<p>I am committed to advocating for the City of Minneapolis and ensuring that we get the best transit service possible for our communities and that our lakes and trail system are not harmed. I look forward to carefully reviewing the details of the upcoming environmental and freight relocation studies.</p>","summary-2":"I support the continued development of a vibrant downtown Minneapolis with a mix of housing, office and retail.","question-2":"<p>I support the continued development of a vibrant downtown Minneapolis with a mix of housing, office and retail. The city has a key role to use early strategic funding to attract high-quality private investment that advances our city community development goals. Rather than subsidize private development or parking, I would prefer to invest any public funds in public infrastructure, including streets and successful public spaces that attract private development.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Any public spaces developed as part of the Vikings stadium or other developments should be carefully planned and managed to ensure they don’t turn into empty, unused spaces like many other downtown parks. </p>","summary-3":"I support streetcars on the Central/Nicollet corridor. Both streetcars and enhanced bus service have benefits.","question-3":"<p>I support streetcars on the Central/Nicollet transit corridor.  Both streetcars and enhanced bus service have great benefits – both improve transit service, can attract new riders and spur development. However, in comparable cities, the kind of enhanced bus that we are proposing in Minneapolis – buses running in mixed traffic – do not have the type of benefits seen with streetcars. (Cities have had great success with fully separated, high-quality Bus Rapid Transit achieving similar impacts as streetcar, but that is not what we are proposing.)</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>The Nicollet/Central corridor is a good location for our first streetcar line because there is enough existing transit ridership but the potential for much more, and streetcars are good at attracting new transit riders. There is a lot of development potential along the corridor, making it likely that the city will recuperate its capital investment, and allowing us to leverage a relatively small amount of local funds for regional and (as long as the Metropolitan Council is supportive) federal transit investment dollars. A streetcar should help realize the redevelopment of the K-Mart store site, reopening Lake at Nicollet, which is a high priority for our community and for my first term.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>As we develop our streetcar/enhanced bus system, I will work to ensure two things: 1) that transportation investments are tied to good land use planning, and 2) that capital investments are made strategically and equitably in the city.</p>","summary-4":"I am particularly committed to ensuring our children have the opportunity to be healthy and develop good lifelong habits.","question-4":"<p>I am committed to working with my colleagues and Minneapolis communities to close all of these gaps. Our gap in health is one of the highest in the nation and is, in part, the result of disinvestment in some Minneapolis neighborhoods and inequitable access to physical activity and healthy foods. </p>\n<p></p>\n<p>I am particularly committed to ensuring our children have the opportunity to be healthy and develop good lifelong habits. I support a number of strategies to achieve this: 1) provide safe walking and bicycling infrastructure in all Minneapolis neighborhoods to support daily activity, 2) specifically support our Safe Routes to School program, which has a number of benefits for our kids, 3) promote urban farming and community gardening as one way to teach kids about healthy food choices, and 4) support efforts to provide healthy foods in our public schools.</p>\n","summary-5":"For both [renters and homeowners], increasing housing options and growing the city’s population will be beneficial.","question-5":"<p>The residents of Ward 10 are most concerned with the impacts of growth and change on our neighborhoods. The cost of housing is a concern for renters, who make up 70 percent of the ward’s population, and homeowners alike. For both, increasing housing options and growing the city’s population and tax base will be beneficial, but there is concern about the impacts of development.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>To address this, I will 1) work to support good urban design and great public spaces in our city and neighborhoods, 2) advocate for investment in transportation options, including safe bicycling and walking and efficient transit, to minimize congestion, 3) support real preservation strategies that work to preserve the character of our neighborhoods, and 4) work to implement the city’s Climate Action Plan so that our population growth means less, not more, regional impact on the environment.</p>","summary-6":"I will work toward making system-wide reforms that benefit the neighborhoods of Ward 10 and the city as a whole.","question-6":"<p>At the end of the day, each neighborhood has to succeed for our whole city to succeed. I will work toward making system-wide reforms that benefit the neighborhoods of Ward 10 and the city as a whole. I am committed to protecting our beautiful lakes and river, supporting cultural institutions and our local arts community, to providing transportation options, supporting our small-business community and growing the city while preserving the historic character of our neighborhoods.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>As policy-makers, we have to do our best to balance many competing needs. In this time of scarce resources, we must be strategic and have a high bar for investment of public dollars. It is my commitment to prioritize closing our city’s equity gaps and to involving and honoring the needs of residents from all walks of life and every stage of life. Minneapolis can and should protect our high quality of life and make our city an even better place to live in the future.</p>",rowNumber:1},{id:9,candidate:"Alondra Cano",image:"AlondraCano250.jpg","summary-1":"I am still gathering information and meeting with stakeholders on this issue and have not taken a position.","question-1":"<p>I am still gathering information and meeting with stakeholders on this issue and have not taken a position on this project. Naturally, it matters to me that last year’s City Council opposed the plans to run both freight trains and light rail into Minneapolis through Kenilworth – their time and attention to this subject matters, and I will take this into heavy consideration as I make up my decision.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>In the meantime, I will be evaluating this project from an environmental impact lens, will listen to neighborhood concerns, meet with policy-makers from other jurisdictions to find common ground and identify mutual benefits as well as work to ensure that this project serves the people of Minneapolis.</p>","summary-2":"We need to ensure that any development integrates a comprehensive racial equity agenda.","question-2":"<p>We need to ensure that any development near the stadium integrates a comprehensive racial equity agenda that cuts through the themes of job creation, economic justice, environmental sustainability, transportation and community engagement. The city should work with public and private partners to establish overall principles that can guide the type of development that can happen in this area. These principles or values should seek to uplift traditionally marginalized communities, people of color and low-income families.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p> As city government, we should have a proactive approach in identifying, recruiting, and supporting the types of development (business, entertainment, programs or projects) that will help our city close the racial disparities gap in health, income, education and overall access. The city can help these new developments set aggressive hiring goals and business practices that can level the playing field for those of our residents with the least amount of resources or opportunities for advancement – from hiring minority contractors to build the new structures to hiring a diverse workforce and providing living-wage jobs through the new and permanent jobs that will be created in this region. </p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Additionally, a strong environmental and sustainable plan should be put in place to ensure that large-scale composting, recycling, and renewable-energy mechanisms are a part of this area’s new development. New development in this area should strive to be innovative, creative and welcoming of use by the general public by providing free and open indoor and outdoor spaces for communities to congregate, organize and reclaim our cultural and progressive traditions.</p>","summary-3":"I lean toward the streetcar option because I believe it will provide more opportunities for community-building.","question-3":"<p>I lean towards the streetcar option because I believe it will provide more opportunities for community-building, business growth and engaged residents. A streetcar culture, when implemented equitably, promotes more relationship-building between people and fosters a community sense of engagement, visibility and connections. From a transportation perspective, because an overwhelming majority of the users of bus services on Nicollet make short trips and stops are very frequent, a streetcar option would serve the residents in a more efficient and environmentally friendly manner.</p>","summary-4":"The city needs to take care of basic bread-and-butter issues before we can pretend to tackle any educational policy.","question-4":"<p>The best way for the city to help solve the education gap is to do our work in:</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>&bull; Creating stable, affordable housing. This includes working with the banks and community to ensure that unfair foreclosures are prevented and that vacant homes are being utilized by people without homes or artists.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>&bull; Pushing for raising the minimum wage and creating educational and training opportunities for the most disenfranchised community members to advance.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>&bull; Setting focused and intentional plans to create and provide jobs for low-income families and racial groups experiencing deep unemployment.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>&bull; Invest in regions of the city that have huge potential for place-making through cultural and economic corridors like Lake Street, Franklin Avenue and Chicago Avenue.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>The city needs to take care of some of these basic bread-and-butter issues before we can pretend to tackle any type of educational policy. If we do our job in providing families good economic opportunities, pass policy to promote healthy neighborhoods and fund culturally relevant and community organizing efforts at the neighborhood-association level, we will help move the dial closer to closing the educational opportunities gap.</p>","summary-5":"We do not have one pressing issue but many, and most are always grounded in social justice and equity values.","question-5":"<p>The Ninth Ward is the most diverse ward in the entire city. We have the largest population of Native American residents in Minneapolis. We have a thriving Latino and immigrant population comprising nearly 35 percent of the ward’s total population. Historically, we have been home to a strong African-American middle class that helped to elect the first black woman to be mayor (Sharon Sayles Belton). We also have a mosque and visible East African immigrant families as well as a very active LGBTQ community. We are an extremely progressive area with radical roots and an anarchist bent.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>For this reason, we do not have one pressing issue but many, and most are always grounded in social justice and equity values -- from fighting environmental racism to improving biking and walking infrastructure as well as public transit; attracting major investments (to make up for the historical disinvestment in our area) that will make a permanent home for the Midtown Farmers’ Market, stabilize Mercado Central Cooperative and the Latino cultural corridor and revitalize the Chicago Avenue corridor; to raising the minimum wage, immigrant rights and protecting our bees or legalizing goats in the city.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>We care about transportation that is oriented for people, not cars. We want economic opportunities, educational programs that can empower people to break the cycle of poverty, and promote home ownership for Native American families and low-income folks. We prioritize racial equity and women’s issues. We want young people engaged and connected. We live in an area that wants cultural empowerment and cultural assets to thrive and grow. These are all guiding values that color the priority projects for our ward. We see safety as an outcome of the quality of opportunities granted to everyone, not just the 1 percent. Residents truly prioritize ward needs based on the late Sen. Paul Wellstone’s motto, “We all do better when we all do better.”</p>","summary-6":"Decisions based on a moral compass that seeks to equalize the playing field is very important.","question-6":"<p>There are universal values that will ensure that our entire city will thrive. Two of those are racial equity and environmental sustainability. Racial equity outcomes are my North Star, my guiding compass and how I make most of my decisions. </p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Regardless of what part of the city is being impacted, making decisions based on a moral compass that seeks to equalize the playing field is very important. It’s the only way to achieve balance and harmony in city-making. My decisions seek to engage those who have never been engaged before and represent the issues and concerns of those who are systematically barred from participating in our democracy. We are all in this together and our connections are deeper than we think. Making decisions based on this interconnected social fabric ensures that we are truly moving toward a One Minneapolis.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>With that said, I hope every council member will remember our strategic-planning facilitator’s advice prescribed by Dr. Seuss: “So be sure when you step, step with care and great tact. And remember that life's a great balancing act.”</p>",rowNumber:2},{id:3,candidate:"Jacob Frey",image:"JacobFrey250.jpg","summary-1":"I have not seen a plan that accounts for community concerns, environmental impact and private investment.","question-1":"<p>We cannot be a first-class city without substantial investments in public transportation, and specifically a Southwest line in some form. That being said, I have not seen a rail transit plan that properly accounts for community concerns, environmental impacts and optimal private investment. I would like to see final results from the studies presently being carried out before making a final decision.</p>","summary-2":"A well-executed plan for the area surrounding the new Vikings stadium is critical for the success of our city.","question-2":"<p>A well-executed plan for the area surrounding the new Vikings stadium is critical for the success of the new Third Ward and our city, perhaps even more so than the stadium itself.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>There are five blocks adjacent to the stadium. Two of those blocks will be occupied by 30-story towers. The towers will include substantial commercial (likely Wells Fargo office space), approximately 42,000 square feet of retail, and 300 residential units. One block will be a parking garage. And the final two blocks will be converted to a park, referred to as “The Yard.”</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Two important facets of this development will be (1) the funding mechanisms, and (2) ensuring an adequate number of eyes on the park. Both of these items can be achieved through a proactive City Council and mayor willing to promote the area as a first-class investment (and it most certainly is). By affirmatively promoting investment and development for the air rights above the parking garage, and pressing for additional residential units surrounding the park, we can make sure that there are adequate “eyes on the park” to reduce crime, while generating substantial revenue for the city.</p>","summary-3":"The main reason I am for streetcars is the “cool factor.” They make our city dynamic and exciting.","question-3":"<p>I favor the implementation of streetcars. Streetcars are a beloved part our history, but I will help them be the wave of our future. Streetcars have great advantages. They are even with the ground, thus allowing a disabled person to easily enter and exit. Additionally, they have wider aisles and deliver a smoother ride than traditional buses.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>But the main reason I am for streetcars is the “cool factor.” They make our city dynamic and exciting. And, others cities have seen over $1 billion worth of private investment along the corridors in which they run. Such positive development could revitalize stagnant sections of our city and could bolster areas that are experiencing success.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>In addition to the initial planned line along Nicollet to Central Avenue in Northeast, I would like to see two additional lines. One should run downtown -- down Washington Avenue. and back on Third or Fourth Street. If this line is extended to Broadway, my hope is that North Minneapolis will benefit from substantial economic investment. I would like to see an additional line running down University and back Fourth Street on the East Side.   </p>","summary-4":"I look forward to working with Mayor Betsy Hodges toward results that uplift every member of our city.","question-4":"<p>The blatant opportunity gaps are perhaps the biggest issue facing our city. We must take action now! However, diverging policy plans from every single city council member will not help us move forward at the pace and level of efficacy necessary to solve the problem. We need leadership specifically from our mayor. I will full-heartedly support our Mayor Elect Betsy Hodges, and look forward to working with her toward results that uplift every member of our city.</p>","summary-5":"Our staggering education gap, homelessness and urbanization are front and center.","question-5":"<p>The new Third Ward is the economic engine, entertainment mecca, professional sports capital and intellectual center of our entire region. With downtown Minneapolis, sports stadiums, the arts district and parts of the University of Minnesota, pressing concerns in the Third Ward spread far beyond the ward itself. With this in mind, our staggering education gap, homelessness (which touches on housing needs and job creation) and urbanization (bringing more people back to our great city) are front and center.</p>","summary-6":"Every policy issue should be met with the following question: What will benefit our city the most?","question-6":"<p>I don’t think it’s a balance at all. One of the major problems with our present governing structure is that we have a relatively weak mayor system with council members that are not elected “at large,” but rather have their own individual “fiefdoms.” We need to move away from a segmented Minneapolis, and away from a system that grants political deference to council members on projects taking place in their respective wards. Every policy issue should be met with the following question: What will benefit our city the most? In answering that question, we take strides toward the best collective results for our city.</p>",rowNumber:3},{id:12,candidate:"Andrew Johnson",image:"AndrewJohnson250.jpg","summary-1":"SWLRT offers so many benefits to Minneapolis, and I am committed to seeing it built.","question-1":"<p>This is a massive project, one which I have immersed myself in the details of, weighing everything from route selection to the politics regarding freight and funding.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>SWLRT offers so many benefits to Minneapolis, and I am committed to seeing it built. While I am still carefully considering all options, the shallow tunnel appears to be the most viable one, provided the hydrogeological study comes back without concerns.</p>","summary-2":"The Ryan project is exciting, and I would love to see a mini “central park” downtown.","question-2":"<p>The Ryan project is exciting, and I would love to see a mini “central park” downtown. I am not a fan of public subsidies for private projects, but I will happily consider responsible investments in public infrastructure, which in turn help stimulate private development.</p>","summary-3":"I lean towards streetcars over enhanced bus service, but the big question is how we would fund them.","question-3":"<p>I lean towards streetcars over enhanced bus service, but the big question is how we would fund them… that could be a deal-breaker.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>In terms of value, streetcars offer a lower cost per rider than LRT while having a similar ability to attract new ridership and stimulate private development.</p>","summary-4":"We can’t simply do one thing here and one thing there. We need to be strategic and address things in a systemic way.","question-4":"<p>The achievement gap is a symptom. Its root causes are based on issues of food security, social justice, community safety and the economic opportunities available to families. These are issues the City Council can and should tackle, which in turn affect the outcomes within the classroom.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>I know you want specifics, and where I struggle within this questionnaire is from turning it into an essay. The issues of the achievement gap and disparities in general are complex and interrelated. We can’t simply do one thing here and one thing there. We need to be strategic and address many things together in a systemic way.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p> For instance, addressing the issues of economic opportunities available to families requires changes to our business ordinances and processes to cut red tape, additional grants and support for entrepreneurs of color, transit improvements, training, making advances in living wages, rebranding communities, proactively recruiting businesses, etc. It involves collaborating with residents and neighborhood associations, business leaders, multiple levels of government, and of course all of my colleagues and our new mayor. It is not easy, it will take time, yet this is one of the ways we can really make a difference that will help families and in turn help children enter the classroom ready to learn.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>I also have a personal goal to see every young person get their hands in the soil, learn where their food comes from and learn how to prepare it.

The city should use this opportunity to showcase what makes Minneapolis unique: its vibrant public spaces, its walkability and its cultural diversity. I’d like to work with our Community Planning & Economic Development staff to implement strategies for bringing independently owned businesses to the stadium, particularly those that represent our biggest minority groups.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>We should prioritize “Complete Streets” that allow for safe transportation for all modes: pedestrians — including those requiring ADA accessibility, cyclists, transit riders and private vehicles, and we should take advantage of the stadium’s proximity to the Mississippi by building connections to existing riverfront development.  For example, a cycle center for secure bike parking and rentals near the stadium would be a great amenity for visitors and residents alike, and we could look to the private sector for potential partners. We can allow for small-area planning while not being too “prescriptive,” meaning, we can ensure the zoning on restaurant establishments and work toward an activity center year-round and with interest of residents and workers as well as visitors.</p>","summary-3":"Although enhanced bus service costs less to build, streetcars are more likely to support economic development.","question-3":"<p>Over 3,000 people participated in the public outreach that took place as part of the Alternatives Analysis for transit in the Nicollet-Central Corridor. This public sentiment, supported by rigorous technical analysis, formed the basis of streetcars being selected as the Locally Preferred Alternative. Although enhanced bus service costs less to build, streetcars have similar operating and maintenance costs on a per-passenger basis and are more likely to support economic development in the corridor. Given the lifespan of transit investments, I believe it is wise to take a long-range view. I stand behind the will of the people and the technical experts in their decision.</p>","summary-4":"Without secure housing, significant improvements cannot be made in health care, education or employment.","question-4":"<p>Minneapolis faces daunting problems of inequity in all of these areas. It is my belief that without safe and secure housing, significant improvements cannot be made in health care, education or employment. I will be examining the barriers to the development of affordable housing in the city, and looking at ways to incentivize developers to create more units of affordable housing in every ward. Location Efficient Mortgages are another way to increase borrowing power for people who choose to live in transit-rich areas, and I plan to look into the viability of bringing that financing program to Minneapolis.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Specifically working to coordinate services for children that live without a permanent address is a special concern of mine, and I am looking for ways to reduce the workload placed upon teachers in coordinating services between the county and the city, and see if there is a better way to deliver intervention.</p>","summary-5":"Taxes, the environment, safety and education are all of largest concern in my community.","question-5":"<p>Taxes, the environment, safety and education are all of largest concern in my community.  Infill housing (teardowns of existing homes to erect larger new homes) is one of the most pressing concerns in our ward. With the economy rebounding, it’s hard to find a single block that hasn’t been impacted by construction. Although we’re thrilled to be such a desired community, we need to find a way to improve the construction process and outcomes. I will be reviewing the existing Infill Housing Ordinance to see if there are opportunities to strengthen it, comparing Minneapolis building code to other municipalities, to see if improvements can be made (particularly to allowable materials), and researching what can be done through legislation to improve quality of life issues for neighbors — noise, dirt, damage to our natural environment, and even where Port-A-Potties can be placed. Teardowns affect our ability to encourage a friendly and diverse community, and I am working on partnerships with neighborhood groups, the U of M and the planning department to assist in policy modification.</p>","summary-6":"Change starts at the local level, but productive change cannot happen at the expense of our larger community.","question-6":"<p>Change starts at the local level, but productive change cannot happen at the expense of our larger community. If I suspect conflicts might occur, I will use my personal associations across the city to gain perspective and insight. We are fortunate to live in a city with such a breadth of resources, and I will use all of the tools at my disposal (universities, policy-makers, small-business owners, community leaders) to inform my decisions. I have plenty to learn in the next four years, and I’m looking forward to the challenges ahead.</p>",rowNumber:5},{id:6,candidate:"Abdi Warsame",image:"AbdiWarsame250.jpg","summary-1":"I acknowledge concerns about any plan that runs both freight and light rail through the Kenilworth Corridor.","question-1":"<p>Expanding the transit system in the metro area is a wise and prudent investment. However, I also acknowledge outstanding concerns in regards to any plan that runs both freight trains and light rail into Minneapolis through the Kenilworth Corridor at ground level. I believe that all concerns and impacts should be identified fairly and addressed fully.</p>","summary-2":"My priorities include promoting a strong commercial core and growing downtown as a hub for arts, culture and entertainment.","question-2":"<p>My priorities for the development of that area are centered on continued growth. Those priorities include promoting a strong commercial core and growing our downtown as a hub for arts, culture and entertainment. I think there’s room for the city to guide, foster and encourage development. The city has an opportunity to assess needs and resources.</p>","summary-3":"I view streetcars with permanent construction as a strong catalyst for development.","question-3":"<p>I view streetcars with permanent construction as a strong catalyst for development. The Central-Nicollet route houses 90,000 residents within half a mile and provides access to 125,000 jobs. This development will help sustain growth in both population and in services that cater to our population.</p>","summary-4":"I plan to partner with labor unions and technical schools so that residents have access to training.","question-4":"<p>The achievement and opportunity gaps are issues that transcend ideology &mdash; they are issues that must be solved. In me you have a collaborator and a convener, not an ideologue. As a council member, I will bring people together to take incremental steps on our seemingly most intractable problems. Creating jobs is a primary focus for my office. I plan to partner with labor unions and technical schools so that residents of my Ward have access to registered apprenticeships and technical training that our local markets demand.</p>","summary-5":"I cannot focus on just one issue but will be dedicated to serving the needs of every community.","question-5":"<p>There are many urgent issues facing my ward. As a council member, I cannot focus on just one issue but will be dedicated to serving the needs of every community. That means working proactively with colleagues and staff to close opportunity gaps, working with businesses and labor unions to create high-quality living wage jobs, working with neighborhood organizations to make our ward greener, and working with security agencies to make our streets and neighborhoods safer.</p>","summary-6":"My ward interests often parallel with city-wide priorities of growth, equity and economic development.","question-6":"<p>My ward interests often parallel with city-wide priorities of growth, equity and economic development.

Other cities have experienced significant high-density development around transit that provides increased economic benefits for those cities, and I would hope that is the case here. But, I need to see more information regarding all routing options before making an informed decision. And, I need to know specifically how the routing options may impact Ward 5 residents.</p>","summary-2":"The city must minimize subsidies in this development, given the large subsidy the Vikings stadium will receive.","question-2":"<p>As I understand it, Wells Fargo is considering building a campus near the stadium which may provide significant job possibilities for the residents of the city, including those in Ward 5. I would like to dig deeper to determine exactly what kinds of opportunities may come of that. I’m also wondering, however, if there might be a chance to match city residents as apprentices with master tradesmen — plumbers, electricians and carpenters, for example — working on the stadium and other development so that some people who need living-wage work might build skills in those trades. I think the city might be able to facilitate those connections in pursuit of widening the job opportunities that come out of this project.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Additionally, I think the City must minimize the use of subsidies in this development, given the large subsidy that the Vikings stadium will receive. If we continue to subsidize the downtown areas, such as the area near the new Vikings stadium, at the expense of other areas like the Northside, we will continue to see the huge disparities that are currently problematic in our city.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>The city must foster development in the neediest areas first. It is incumbent on the city to focus its attention on the Northside, an area that has been neglected for far too long.</p>","summary-3":"I believe that as a city, we must focus on basic services first. I see streetcars as a luxury.","question-3":"<p>I am doing more study on the question of how streetcars fit into our transportation needs now and in the future. I’m concerned that West Broadway is too narrow to accommodate streetcars, and I’d like to see the environmental and pre-development activity studies as well as other analyses on how streetcars compare to enhanced bus service before I come to a final conclusion.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>I believe that as a city, we must focus on basic services first. I see streetcars as a luxury. If the Northside has the opportunity to choose between streetcars or the money that will be spent on them ($50 million per mile), I believe that the money (used however we see fit) would do more for economic development than streetcars.</p>\n","summary-4":"There’s a definite opportunity here to have a significant impact on the health care gap.","question-4":"<p>In the area of health care, I think the people in Ward 5 will benefit tremendously from the insurance benefits that are offered through MNSure, our state health care exchange. There’s a definite opportunity here to have a significant impact on the health care gap. In spite of the October launch, there is still a great deal of misinformation in circulation regarding the Affordable Care Act and what it offers, including confusion about health tax credits, subsidies and just generally the health benefits that are available.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Not everyone has a home computer, and there is a digital divide, so it’s my intent to ensure that trusted grass-roots organizations on the ground in Ward 5 and across the city are getting the word out to everyone that health insurance is available and can be affordable no matter your budget or circumstances. Information can go a long way toward closing the health care gap that has the greatest impact on people who are most vulnerable, particularly low-income households.</p>","summary-5":"For my ward, the greatest concerns are safety from violence, especially gun violence, and access to living-wage jobs.","question-5":"<p>For people in my ward, the greatest concerns are safety from violence, especially gun violence, and access to living-wage jobs. I think a basic common-sense approach to the question of safety is to ensure that there are enough police officers to adequately patrol Minneapolis. Right now, the police department says they’re short about 100 officers. We need to allocate the funds to hire those officers. In addition, I think we should institute a robust community-policing model with officers out walking the streets and biking in our neighborhoods so that the police come to know neighbors in our community and community members get to know them. Frankly, that could go a long way toward mitigating the distrust that some Northsiders feel toward the police and reducing the fear that police have of our community.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>In terms of living-wage jobs, it’s my intent to work tirelessly to attract new businesses to North Minneapolis, including small and minority-owned businesses. The city can help there by cutting red tape around business development and fostering a more business-friendly environment.</p>","summary-6":"My constituents are my focus, but I recognize that as a city councilman, I am a policy-maker for all of Minneapolis.","question-6":"<p>I’ll listen to all sides of any argument &mdash; including input from my constituents — and make decisions based on what benefits the residents of Ward 5. At times when there is a conflict, I’ll try to compromise in ways that don’t unduly disadvantage the people who voted me into office.
